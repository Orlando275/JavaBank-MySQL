## 🎯 Project Overview

JavaBank-MySQL is a Java-based desktop banking system where you can:

- 🔐 **Securely log in or register** with password hashing and database validation.  
- 💳 **Manage accounts** with real-time deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.  
- 📈 **View transaction history** with sortable and filterable records for each user.  
- 🖥️ **Navigate seamlessly** through a multi-window Java Swing interface.  
- 🛠 **Easily extend features** thanks to a clean, modular MVC architecture.  

This project is designed to showcase robust Java application development, database integration with MySQL, and professional-grade UI/UX design in a multi-window desktop environment.

## 📥 Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Orlando275/JavaBank-MySQL.git
    ```

2. Configure your Java project

    - If you’re using Maven, add the MySQL Connector/J dependency in your `pom.xml`.
    - If you’re using Gradle, include the connector in your `build.gradle`.
    - Or download the JDBC driver JAR of your choice, place it in a `lib/` directory, and add it to your classpath.

3. Build and run

    ```bash
    # With Maven
    mvn clean install
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.project_.Main"

    # With Gradle
    gradle build
    gradle run
    ```

## 💾 Database Setup

Create the `project_bank` database and `users` table by executing the following SQL (via MySQL Workbench, CLI, etc.):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE project_bank;
USE project_bank;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email    VARCHAR(255),
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

## 🔌 JDBC Driver Installation

- Download the JDBC driver for your database (e.g., MySQL Connector/J).  
- Place the JAR in your project’s `lib/` folder or register it as a Maven/Gradle dependency.  
- Ensure the driver is on the runtime classpath so the application can connect to `project_bank`.

## 🚀 How It Works

- **Startup** – `Main.java` initializes the Swing UI and establishes a JDBC connection to `project_bank`.  
- **Authentication** – User credentials are validated against the `users` table; new users can register.  
- **Account Operations** – Deposit and withdrawal actions update the database and UI in real time.  
- **Transaction Logging** – Every operation is recorded and fetched for display in the history view.  
- **Modularity** – Controllers handle user interactions, DAOs manage SQL queries, and models represent core entities — making feature additions straightforward.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java 11+**  
- **Java Swing** (UI)  
- **JDBC / MySQL Connector/J**  
- **MySQL 8**  
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (build tool)  
- **Docker** *(optional containerization)*  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add role-based access control (admin vs. customer)  
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest  
- Integrate real-time notifications *(e.g., balance alerts)*  
- Build a web front-end with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf  
- Implement unit tests using JUnit and Mockito
